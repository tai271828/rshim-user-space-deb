Description: Userspace (fuse) host driver for Mellanox BlueField devices
 This is a userspace driver that provides host access to BlueField PCIe
 devices. It can be used to push boot streams (usually to flash a new OS
 image), access a virtual console, provide a virtual network interface
 connecting the BlueField device and its host, and a debug interface.
